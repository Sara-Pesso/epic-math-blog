# Introduction

As alluded to in the [first blog post of this series](), we are now on to the second dynamic programming heuristic of interest when it comes to solving the [Secret Santa Question (SSQ)](): using dynamic programming to find a unique Hamiltonian Cycle through a graph.  

If you haven't read the posts in this series up to this point, I recommend going back to check them out! I am going to be referencing ideas discussed in those posts without rehashing them in depth in this post. Without further ado, let's jump into how to find a Hamiltonian Cycle with dynamic programming and how is fits into the Secret Santa problem!  

# Tabulation
0. Like we discussed previously in the original [SSQ blog post](), our function will in take an **adjacency matrix** to describe valid connections between nodes, let's call this matrix $C$. Then, an element $C_{i,j}$ represents whether there is a valid path from node $i$ to node $j$-- 1 means there is a connection, 0 means there is not. As an example:
```python
adj = [
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
]
```
We will have our function return the DP table and a boolean variable indicating whether our graph contains a Hamiltonian Cycle. So, we know our outputs will look like this:
```python
ham_check, dp = find_hamiltonian_cycle(adj)
```

OK-- now let's do a deep dive into the weeds of how this algorithm works!

1. Initialize variables needed for DP algorithm: find $n$ the (number of nodes), calculate the total number of states ($2^n$, represented by a $n$-bit bitmask). 
```python
# Number of nodes
n = len(adj_matrix)
# Total combinations of nodes is 2^n
num_states = 1 << n
```

2. Also, initialize the DP table: $-1$, ```NaN```, or other values that do not appear as node indices are appropriate. This DP table will map the tuple containing the resultant bitmask from traveling to node $j$ to the node one step previous, node $i$. Also, we can (arbitrarily) start at node $0$, so ```dp[0][0] = 0```, and we can initialize ```dp[1][0] = 0```. This is equivalent to realizing that at bitmask $1$, we had to have come from node $0$. 
```python
dp = [[-1] * n for _ in range(num_states)]
dp[1][0] = 0
```

3. Iterate through all the bitmasks and in a nested loop, iterate through each node. Recall that the bitmask simply represents the nodes that have already been visited on our path. 
```python
for mask in range(num_states):
        for i in range(n):
```

4. Check the DP table for the current bitmask and node $i$ combination. If the value currently stored in the DP table is $-1$ (or whatever empty value you have chosen) we need to skip, as the bitmask is unattainable. This may be slightly confusing to think about at first, but because we are excluding edges from our graph (i.e., connections between nodes), there are going to be certain bitmask-object combinations that lead to invalid results. So, skip to the next bitmask and repeat.
```python
if dp[mask][i] == -1:
    continue
```

5. Since we are first iterating through the *bitmasks*, as we iterate through the nested loop of nodes we need to verify that node $i$ is actually passed through in the current bitmask. We can do this by checking that the $i^{th}$ bit is set in the current bitmask using the bitwise operators we discussed previously. 
```python
if mask & (1 << i):
```

6. Begin looping through the *next* nodes-- another nested loop iterating through the nodes. Now, we will have node $i$ (the node we are currently stationed at) and node $j$ (a possible next node to move to).
```python
    for j in range(n):
```

7. So now we can check if we can see if moving from node $i$ to node $j$ is a valid move:
    - We've previously verified that node $i$ appears in the current bit mask.
    - Next, we'll need to check that $i \not = j$ (obviously we can't move from a node to itself)
    - Check that node $j$ is not already in the bitmask using the bitwise operators (if the $j^{th}$ bit is already set, it means we've already passed through node $j$ in this bitmask)
    - And finally, verify that node $i$ is allowed to connect to node $j$, using the adjacency matrix
```python
    if j != i and not (mask & (1 << j)) and adj_matrix[i][j]:
```

8. If all these checks are passed, then the connection is valid. Add it to the bitmask and the DP table. Simply, the next bitmask will have the $j^{th}$ bit set, and the DP table will map this new mask and node $j$, back to the previous node $i$. Recording it like this will make it easier to decode the DP table later on an report the Hamiltonian Path we are currently working to find. 
```python
    next_mask = mask | (1 << j)
    dp[next_mask][j] = i
```

9. Finally, once the nested loops are completed all we need to do is finish the loop by verifying that the last node $i \not = 0$ can in fact connect back to node $0$ (the starting point) at the "full" bitmask-- that is, the bitmask of all ones. If this is the case, terminate the function by returning ```True``` (is in a Hamiltonian Cycle through the graph exists) and the DP table. Otherwise, return ```False``` and the DP table. 
```python
full_mask = num_states - 1
for i in range(n):
    if dp[full_mask][i] and adj_matrix[i][0]:
        return True, dp
        
return False, dp
```
## Reconstructing the Hamiltonian Cycle from the DP Table

The last thing we need to do is use the resultant DP table to decode a valid Hamiltonian Cycle through our graph (adjacency matrix-- same thing!). 

1. Our function outputs a boolean variable indicating whether there is a valid Hamiltonian Cycle somewhere in the graph. So, first we will check that it's been set to ```True``` in our algorithm. Otherwise, there's no Hamiltonian Cycle and we'll output that as the result. 
```python
if ham_check: 
```

2. Set some variables with values we will need:
    - $n$ = the number of nodes in the graph
    - The full mask; the bitmask of all 1s that will indicate we have traveled through all the nodes
    - A flag indicating whether the final was able to loop back to node $0$
```python
n = len(adj)
final_mask = (1 << n) - 1
end_node = -1
```

3. Loop through all the nodes: before we start working backwards through the DP table to decode the Hamiltonian Cycle it hold, we need to find the final node that the Hamiltonian Cycle passes through before heading back to node $0$. If the DP table of the full mask (bitmask of all ones indicating we've passed through all the nodes) and the node $i$ is not $-1$ (i.e., we visit all nodes) and node $i$ can connect to node $0$, we'll overwrite the ```end_node``` flag with index $i$. This will tell us the final node $i \not = 0$ in the Hamiltonian Cycle.
```python
for i in range(n):
    if dp[final_mask][i] != -1 and adj[i][0] == 1:
        end_node = i
        break
```
4. If we make it through this process and the ```end_node``` flag is never overwritten with the index of a valid end node, there is no Hamiltonian Cycle, and we report as such.
```python
if end_node == -1: 
    print("No Hamiltonian Cycle")
```

5. If there is a valid ```end_node``` set in our flag, we will proceed decoding the DP table! First, we'll set some more variables we will need to complete this task:
    - Initialize an empty list that we will fill in with the node order as we go (we are going from the final node backwards, so eventually we will reverse the order of this list)
    - Set the current node to ```end_node```-- this is where we will start (at the end!)
    - And since we are starting at the end, we will start at the "full" mask (again, the bitmask of all ones indicating we've passed through all the nodes). 
```python
else:
    ham_cycle = []
    current_node = end_node
    current_mask = final_mask
```

6. To actually work our way through the DP table to decode the Hamiltonian we found is fairly straight forward. Starting from the last node and "full" bitmask, find the previous node from the DP table. You'll remember from earlier we set up our DP table to map the tuple of node $j$ and resultant bitmask, to the previous node $i$ we originally came from (after a series of checks to make sure the transition was valid). So, it's as simple as just finding the previous node from that fact. Then, we can update the bitmask (with our bitwise operators) *removing* the current node from the bitmask. This is what the bitmask looked like when we originally recorded this transition in the DP table. Now we have the previous node and bitmask we need to repeat this process, recording the reverse order of the nodes as we go. We'll repeat this until we are at bitmask 0 (where no nodes have been passed through). 
```python
while current_mask > 0:
    ham_cycle.append(current_node)
    prev_node = dp[current_mask][current_node]
    current_mask = current_mask ^ (1 << current_node) # Remove current node from mask
    current_node = prev_node
```
7. Reverse the order of the list using Python list operations since we start working backwards from the last node. Then, for posterity's sake, record that we are ending back at node 0 by appending it to the end of our list. 
```python
ham_cycle.reverse()
ham_cycle.append(0)
```
And there you have it! We've successfully found that 1) a Hamiltonian Cycle exists in our graph and 2) found the order of the nodes in the Hamiltonian Cycle!

# Applied to the SSQ
We've already discussed in detail the utility of using Hamiltonian Cycles to the Secret Santa Questions in the [original SSQ post](), so we'll rehash it briefly here. If you want a deep-dive into Hamiltonian Cycles and how they and Depth-First Search can be used to solve the SSQ, definitely read that post! It has more information on the subject than anyone could ever need. 

In our SSQ, we are asked to make exclusions between gift-givers and gift receivers; some participants are not allowed to be the Secret Santa for certain other participants. A husband should always get a Christmas gift for his wife, regardless of who he pulls for Secret Santa (and vice versa, ladies!) and we don't want one gift-giver getting the same person several years in a row. Really, the reasons don't matter, we can visualize the web of allowed connections as a **directional graph** or simply a **digraph**, where the *edges* (connections between nodes) are only valid in one direction. 

So, of course finding a Hamiltonian Cycle-- that is, a path through all the nodes, that terminates at the start node-- is a valid assignment of givers to receivers. All that we needed to do was find any ol' Hamiltonian Cycle in our graph (which we represent as an adjacency matrix for the sake of our computer's understanding) and spit that out so all the Secret Santa participants know who to get a present for this Christmas!

# Conclusion & Final Thoughts

Thanks for hanging in there to the end of this post! We have one more heuristic to tackle when it comes to solving the SSQ using dynamic programming-- solving it like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). In my original SSQ post I touched on the fact that this was actually the first analogous problem I recognized in the SSQ, I also think it is a problem that has a lot of utility outside simply solving the SSQ. In fact, (probably) for the final post in the series, I'd like to use some of the algorithms I write to solve a TSP-like problem-- the caveat being this problem is a real-world problem I have run into and is a little more complicated than the TSP. But, before we can jump into that, we'll need a basis in the form of a DP solution to the TSP. Follow along for some more of that!

Happy programming!
